#### [Original music piece](https://youtu.be/ZnRhX98KTPA)


The lyrics of this song come from a poem written by my father named“Black Bird”. My father told me that the poem was written in Qinghai in western China, Qinghai used to be a pure land, but now it has become a tourist destination. Indeed, there is more and more urbanization nowadays, and many animals have lost their homes. So I want, through my music and my understanding of the poem, to alert more people and let more people have a yearning for nature rather than the desire to develop. This song uses a lot of 7th chords, makes the whole song sadder, and also can reflect the heartache and the yearning for better freedom. Some whines like Wu~Wu~; it was more like hearing the wind in the wilderness, very desolate. The other thing is that the end stops on the third note and the Cmaj7 makes the song sound not as clean as the end as if there is always no perfect answer between person and nature.
